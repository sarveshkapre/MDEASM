## Mistakes And Fixes
- Template: YYYY-MM-DD | Issue | Root cause | Fix | Prevention rule | Commit | Confidence
- 2026-02-11 | `CLONE_FEATURES.md` was accidentally truncated during a scripted section rewrite attempt | Used an `awk` one-liner with an invalid variable name and an unconditional move to destination, which replaced the tracker with an empty file | Restored from `git show HEAD:CLONE_FEATURES.md` immediately and switched to bounded `apply_patch` edits for tracker updates | For tracker rewrites, stage changes through `apply_patch` or write to a validated temp file and assert non-zero line count before replace | n/a | high
- 2026-02-11 | `get_workspace_risk_observations()` could raise when no findings were returned | `snapshot_assets` was only initialized in the non-empty metrics branch, but later referenced unconditionally | Initialize `snapshot_assets` before branch evaluation, gate completion messaging, and return structured payload with `noprint` option; add regression test | For any branch-dependent accumulator/collection, initialize before branching and add at least one regression test for the empty-result path | cd9a3e3 | high
- 2026-02-11 | Initial redaction regex missed JSON token fields like `"access_token":"..."` | First-pass sanitization pattern handled `key=value` but not quoted JSON key/value formatting | Added dedicated JSON-field redaction regex and regression tests for bearer + JSON + query-string secret patterns | Add explicit regression cases for every secret shape (header, JSON, key/value, signed URL query) before merging logging/error changes | e955667 | high
- 2026-02-11 | `create_workspace()` could raise `no region` even when `EASM_REGION` was set to a valid value | Region validation mixed fallback and validation in a single `if/else`, causing the valid fallback path to still raise | Split fallback (`if not region`) from validation (`if region not in _easm_regions`) and add regression coverage | Keep env fallback + validation checks separated in control flow and cover both with tests | 97be9c2 | high
- 2026-02-11 | `create_facet_filter(asset_id=...)` could raise before reaching the `asset_id` path | Function always validated `asset_list_name` first, even when only `asset_id` was supplied | Branch validation by mode (`asset_list_name` vs `asset_id`) and add regression coverage | Add tests for every mutually-exclusive argument path before refactoring validation blocks | 97be9c2 | high
- 2026-02-10 | Facet filters for certain list attributes could collapse into `(None, None, ...)` keys | Single-element facet specs in `_facet_filters` were written as `(\"cookieName\")` which is a string in Python, not a tuple, so code iterated characters instead of facet paths | Add trailing commas for single-element tuples and add a focused unit test that asserts the expected tuple keys | Add regression tests for any special-case parsing table (facet specs, schema maps) and ensure single-element tuples use trailing commas | 45c272d | high
- 2026-02-10 | CLI `mdeasm assets export` could emit non-JSON/CSV text before the payload | `Workspaces.__init__` calls `get_workspaces()` which used `print()` to stdout when `WORKSPACE_NAME` was unset and multiple workspaces existed | Emit guidance to stderr instead of stdout; add regression test for stdout cleanliness | Keep stdout-clean tests for any codepath reachable before the CLI writes machine-readable output | b937478 | high
- 2026-02-10 | CLI exports to stdout could produce invalid JSON/CSV | `get_workspace_assets()` printed status/progress to stdout while the CLI also wrote machine-readable output to stdout | Add `status_to_stderr`/`quiet` knobs and make the CLI send status to stderr; add stdout-mode regression tests | Keep stdout-mode tests for CLI and keep status output configurable in helper methods | dc5b59d | high
- 2026-02-10 | `__validate_asset_id__` could raise `UnboundLocalError` for invalid inputs | Base64 decode path didn't validate input and failed to raise when roundtrip check failed, leaving `verified_asset_id` unset | Use `base64.b64decode(..., validate=True)` and raise on non-canonical/non-base64 values | Keep unit tests for invalid asset ids and run `pytest` in CI | 8cd0881 | high
- 2026-02-10 | `date_range_end`-only filtering referenced `date_start` | Copy/paste oversight in date-range condition and exception handling masked the bug | Use `date_end` in the end-only path and add a focused regression test | Add unit tests for each date-filter mode (start-only, end-only, start+end) before changing filtering logic | 1e35eb9 | high

## Known Risks

## Next Prioritized Tasks
- Add real-tenant validation for `mdeasm tasks fetch` protected-URL bearer fallback path (`MDEASM_INTEGRATION_TASK_ARTIFACT=1`), gated behind explicit env flags once credentials are available.
- Continue typed exception migration across remaining broad `Exception` paths (discovery/workspace lifecycle, tasks/report helpers, and asset helper validation).
- Evaluate and add a Python 3.13 CI lane once dependency compatibility is confirmed.
- Add helper + CLI resource-tags CRUD parity for governance metadata workflows.
- Extend docs smoke with one credential-aware, secret-gated real command path when secrets exist.
- Add optional command presets/profile files for repeated export/task automation invocations.
- Add CLI error-code contract tests across doctor/task/data-connection failure classes to keep automation exit behavior stable.
